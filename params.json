{"name":"Ludum Dare 23","body":"mnem's entry for Ludum Dare 23, 48 hour compo\r\n\r\nThis is more a minimal plaything than a game really - I was lacking inspiration this weekend :/ \r\n\r\nYou are Gravity, new on the job, and you've been given a trial period by God, before he decides to keep you on full time. He's been handcrafting words all over the shop, but he's bored and wants a holiday. \r\n\r\nUsing your Audacious Powers of Coalescence, you have to form as many planets as you can from the space dust the boss has left floating around. Be careful! Don't form the planets too close to each other in case they collide. You wouldn't want all those innocent deaths on your conscience. \r\n\r\nTo activate you APoC, simply press the mouse button, hold it, and drag your gravity point around. When enough bits of dust are close together you will pop a new planet into existence. ","tagline":"Tiny Worlds in 48 hours","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
